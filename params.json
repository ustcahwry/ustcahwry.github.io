The transcriptome profile we've performed reveals that Cyclin 2 may play an essential role in DNA mismatch repair during _Tetrahymena Thermophila_ meiosis\r\n\r\n_Qianlan Xu_ , **_Ruoyu Wang_** ,_Xiaoyuan Song_(Draft finished,going to submit on this December)\r\n\r\n**Figure 1: Time course analysis of progression of the nuclear events in delta CYC2**\r\n\r\n####Nascent RNAs Mediate Chromosomal Interactions\r\n<img src=\"http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~ahwry/assets/cdb5d13ad617d8b2a424150040148c23.png\" width=\"35%\" height=\"27%\" align=left>   To address the question that whether nascent RNAs correlate with chromosomal interactions at genome scale, we analyzed whole genome chromosomal interaction data (Hi-C data) and GRO-Seq (Global Run-on Sequence) data from the same cell line (IMR90) generated by Ren Lab at UCSD. Our results showed that nascent RNAs in nuclear positively correlate with Hi-C fragments both in chromosomal interaction number and interaction frequency. This phenomenon suggests that nascent RNAs might mediate chromosomal interactions genome-wide.\r\n\r\n**_Ruoyu Wang_**, _Qi Peng_, _Xiaoyuan Song_\r\n\r\n**Figure 2: Construction of Chromatin Interaction Network**\r\n\r\n####The 3D chromosome conformation and transcriptional regulation of _Tetrahymena thermophila_\r\n<img src=\"http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~ahwry/assets/0f222084ba6fb53a7fe569f94e910486.png\" width=\"35%\" height=\"27%\" align=left> Recently, many researches revealed that chromosome interactions can regulate genes expression. Genes expression are regulated by locus control regions (LCRs) which may located far away from their target genes, but during different development or differentiation they may form long-range intra- or inter-chromosomal loops and localize genes within nuclear regions that favor transcription. \r\n    We are interested in the three dimensional regulation of transcription. So we introduced Hi-C which can identify genome wide long range interactions in micronuclei of _Tetrahymena thermophila_. \r\n\r\n_Zhengyu Luo_, **_Ruoyu Wang_**, _Xiaoyuan Song_\r\n\r\n**Figure 3: HiC heatmap of chr1 in _Tetrahymena thermophila_**\r\n\r\n####Function and mechanism of histone Variant H2A.Y in macronucleus of _Tetrahymena thermophila_\r\n<img src=\"http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~ahwry/assets/99742c52933755297ad18a2248dd3703.png\" width=\"50%\" height=\"27%\" align=left>\r\n\r\n_Qianlan Xu_ , **_Ruoyu Wang_** ,_Xiaoyuan Song_\r\n\r\n\r\n**Figure 4: RNA-seq Heatmap of HTAY K.O.
