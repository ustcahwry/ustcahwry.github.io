The transcriptome profile we've performed reveals that Cyclin 2 may play an essential role in DNA mismatch repair during _Tetrahymena Thermophila_ meiosis\r\n\r\n_Qianlan Xu_ , **_Ruoyu Wang_** ,_Xiaoyuan Song_(**Co First Author, April 2016 _Protein & Cell_**)\r\n\r\n**Figure 1: Time course analysis of progression of the nuclear events in delta CYC2**\r\n\r\n####The 3D genome organization and transcriptional regulation of _Tetrahymena thermophila_\r\n<img src=\"http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~ahwry/assets/Hi-C-3hr.jpg\" width=\"35%\" height=\"27%\" align=left> Recently, many researches revealed that chromosome interactions can regulate genes expression. Genes expression are regulated by locus control regions (LCRs) which may located far away from their target genes, but during different development or differentiation they may form long-range intra- or inter-chromosomal loops and localize genes within nuclear regions that favor transcription. \r\n    We are interested in the three dimensional regulation of transcription. So we introduced Hi-C which can identify genome wide long range interactions in micronuclei of _Tetrahymena thermophila_. \r\n\r\n_Zhengyu Luo_, **_Ruoyu Wang_**, _Xiaoyuan Song_\r\n\r\n**Figure 2: HiC chromatin interaction map of chr1 in _Tetrahymena thermophila_**\r\n\r\n\r\n####High Order Chromatin Organization with Nascent RNA mediating\r\n<img src=\"http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~ahwry/assets/cdb5d13ad617d8b2a424150040148c23.png\" width=\"35%\" height=\"27%\" align=left>   To address the question that whether nascent RNAs correlate with chromosomal interactions at genome scale, we analyzed whole genome chromosomal interaction data (Hi-C data) and GRO-Seq (Global Run-on Sequence) data from the same cell line (IMR90) generated by Ren Lab at UCSD. Our results showed that nascent RNAs in nuclear positively correlate with Hi-C fragments both in chromosomal interaction number and interaction frequency. This phenomenon suggests that nascent RNAs might mediate chromosomal interactions genome-wide.\r\n\r\n**_Ruoyu Wang_**, _Qi Peng_, _Xiaoyuan Song_\r\n\r\n**Figure 3: Construction of RNA Associated Chromatin Interaction Network**\r\n\r\n\r\n####Disease Associated Genetic Variations and 3D genome\r\n \r\n<img src=\"http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~ahwry/assets/SNX19.png\" width=\"35%\" height=\"27%\" align=left> Most of the diseased genetic variations happened in non-coding locus. Besides enhancer dysfunction caused by genetic variations, non-coding mutations may also contribute to high order chromatin structure reorganization. By combining Genome-wide Associated Study data and Hi-C data analysis, We've found a genetic variation loci which is highly associated with Schizophrenia located in Topological Associating Domains(TADs) boundary region. We hypothesized that this boundary region mutation could cause high order chromatin structure changed. And we are using CRISPR-Cas9 to simulate this mutation in normal neuronal cells and using 5C to test our hypothesis.\r\n\r\n**_Ruoyu Wang_**, _Ran Zhang_, _Xiaoyuan Song_\r\n\r\n**Figure 4: The Genetic Mutation Overlapped TADs Boundary Region**\r\n\r\n####Function and mechanism of histone Variant H2A.Y in macronucleus of _Tetrahymena thermophila_\r\n<img src=\"http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~ahwry/assets/99742c52933755297ad18a2248dd3703.png\" width=\"50%\" height=\"27%\" align=left>\r\n\r\n_Qianlan Xu_ , **_Ruoyu Wang_** ,_Xiaoyuan Song_\r\n\r\n\r\n**Figure 5: RNA-seq results of HTAY K.O.
