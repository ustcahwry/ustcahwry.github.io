Our results showed that nascent RNAs in nuclear positively correlate with Hi-C fragments both in chromosomal interaction number and interaction frequency. This phenomenon suggests that nascent RNAs might mediate chromosomal interactions genome-wide.\r\n\r\n**Ruoyu Wang**, Qi Peng, Xiaoyuan Song\r\n\r\n**Figure 1: Construction of Chromatin Interaction Network**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Contact Me\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n>Address：ROOM 908 East wing of Science and Technology Experiment Building  School of life science West Campus USTC  Hefei Anhui 230027  P.R.China \r\n\r\nEmail：ahwry@mail.ustc.edu.cn Tel：+86 18075295566\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
